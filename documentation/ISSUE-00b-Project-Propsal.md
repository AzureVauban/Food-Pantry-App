## <span style="color: #60a5fa; font-weight: 500">Description</span>

This is an inventory manager for food. The main uses for the project would be to upload and "Inventorize" food items to help the end user be more efficient in meal planning, grocery overspending, and knowledge gap in cookings (finding new and learning new recipes). The target audience is college students and couples

## <span style="color: #60a5fa; font-weight: 500">Deliverables</span>

The deliverables for this project will include both a mobile app and a web app. The mobile app emphasizes portability, enabling users to check off items at the store, quickly scan pantry goods, and manage lists on the go. The web app complements this by offering broader accessibility across devices and a more convenient interface for planning tasks such as bulk editing, recipe entry, and collaborative pantry management. Together, these deliverables ensure the project goes beyond a simple food inventory tool to become a comprehensive platform for meal planning and grocery organization, designed to support both everyday use and long-term adoption.

## <span style="color: #60a5fa; font-weight: 500">Tech Stack and Project Workflow</span>

### Tech Stack

| React Native | Gives the group flexibility to divert between a mobile app or a web app and vice versa                                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Firebase     | Having a database is critical for this project, it will store user authentication data and pantry data                                      |
| APIs         | Unresearched as of now, but APIs would most likely be utilized for the following features: Recipe Searching, Grocery Store Price Comparison |
| Expo-EAS     | If mobile app, using a framework such as Expo will take care of deployment to the App Store and Google Play. For website maybe vercel       |

### Project Workflow

The team has chosen to adopt a SCRUM-LITE approach, implemented through GitHub Projects. While traditional SCRUM relies on Epics, User Stories, and Tasks, this project will instead organize work using Milestones and Issues. Milestones serve as high-level goals that can function like Epics or User Stories, while Issues represent the actionable tasks required to complete them.

A key reason for selecting this approach is its flexibility. Milestones and Issues can be easily added, adjusted, or reprioritized without the technical and mental overhead often associated with full SCRUM. At the same time, this method preserves the benefits of clear deadlines and structured planning. By keeping all workflow management within GitHub, the team avoids reliance on third-party tools such as Jira or Bitbucket, ensuring a lightweight and adaptable process that fits the projectâ€™s scope.

### Hardware Requirements

The only hardware requirements are a having a computer to code on and a mobile device (Android or IOS) to test on mobile platforms via Expo Go. There is no server needed because Firebase functions as a BAAS (Backend As a Service), the team will be utilizing this service to offload the work with the backend development.
