- Implementing the recipe search feature using the FatSecret API and integrating it with the existing pantry data system.

<span style="color: #60a5fa; font-weight: 500">Successes</span>

- Successfully set up Firebase as the backend service and connected authentication with the pantry data system.
- Designed and implemented the initial database model for pantry items, ensuring seamless data flow between the app’s backend and user interface.

<span style="color: #60a5fa; font-weight: 500">Issues</span>

- The main issue was not having a usable API, but this has been resolved with the integration of FatSecret.

<span style="color: #60a5fa; font-weight: 500">What will be worked on next</span>

- Will begin collaborating with Martin on the Collaborative Pantry feature once the recipe search integration is completed.

## Michael Elder - Status Report

<span style="color: #60a5fa; font-weight: 500">Currently Working on:</span>

- Implementing functionality for Virtual Pantry feature
- Integration with FatSecret API for Pantry Items

<span style="color: #60a5fa; font-weight: 500">Successes</span>

- Managed to make low-fidelity mockups for all screens
- Looking for a API and getting premier access
- implemented GitHub actions workflow for code Linting
- implemented script to make in-repo documentation management

<span style="color: #60a5fa; font-weight: 500">Issues</span>

- The need to redefine tasks due to unexpected functional intersection between group members leading to confusion and miscommunication on task scope
- Looking for an API took a lot more time than expected, a lot of APIs required payment for basic features and lacked reliability
- API not properly detecting in `pantryview`

<span style="color: #60a5fa; font-weight: 500">What will be worked on next</span>

- Refactor tasks to resolve further miscommunication and confusion to make task scope more concise
- Collaborative Pantry Feature

## Martin Mendoza - Status Report

<span style="color: #60a5fa; font-weight: 500">Currently Working on</span>

- Creating high-fidelity drafts for the Login, Welcome, and Virtual Pantry screens while aligning feature scopes with Michael to avoid task overlap.

<span style="color: #60a5fa; font-weight: 500">Successes</span>

- Completed a low-fidelity mockup for the Grocery List Generator and established the foundation for the design system.

<span style="color: #60a5fa; font-weight: 500">Issues</span>

- Faced challenges identifying affordable APIs that match the project’s requirements; also dependent on Michael’s completion of the Virtual Pantry before progressing with grocery list features.

<span style="color: #60a5fa; font-weight: 500">What will be worked on next</span>

- Once the Virtual Pantry functionality is finalized, will move on to developing the Grocery List Generator feature and refining the UI based on team feedback.

## Rene Sanchez - Status Report

<span style="color: #60a5fa; font-weight: 500">Currently Working on</span>

- Reviewing and reorganizing overlapping tasks with Michael to clarify responsibilities for the Virtual Pantry and Recipe Searching features.
- Adding and Deleting Items from Virtual Pantry

<span style="color: #60a5fa; font-weight: 500">Successes</span>

- Designed the initial UI for the pantry screen and started linking recipe search components to the main pantry interface.

<span style="color: #60a5fa; font-weight: 500">Issues</span>

- First time working with Firebase, which has made setup and data handling difficult; task boundaries with Michael’s work are still being finalized.

<span style="color: #60a5fa; font-weight: 500">What will be worked on next</span>

- Once task scopes are clearly defined, will focus on completing the add, edit, and delete functionality for the Virtual Pantry and ensuring smooth recipe integration.
