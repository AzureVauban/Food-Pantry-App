# ISSUE-59-add-missing-documentation-for-existing-features

**Issue Type(s):** Documentation

## Objective:

The purpose of ISSUE-59 is to review and fill gaps in documentation across existing project modules — ensuring every implemented feature has consistent, concise, and up-to-date documentation. This effort aims to improve maintainability, contributor onboarding, and feature traceability throughout the project.

## Description:

This branch focuses on reviewing major implemented features such as authentication (ISSUE-16), pantry list view (ISSUE-12), ingredient detection and export (ISSUE-37), and core project documentation including prototype and status updates. The task involved writing missing markdown files, aligning objectives and descriptions for clarity, adding commit context to link documentation with code changes, and cleaning up redundant documentation files such as deprecated placeholders to streamline the docs folder.

## What's next:

Next steps involve expanding README-level summaries for each major module to provide high-level overviews, adding architecture diagrams to the `/documentation` folder for visual context, and implementing automatic documentation generation workflows (e.g., via scripts or CI pipelines) to ensure documentation remains current as the project evolves.

## Miscellaneous Notes:

Additional notes include the removal of redundant files as part of the ISSUE-59 placeholder cleanup, embedding Gantt chart references in project-level documentation for scheduling visibility, and improving internal linking between related issues such as ISSUE-9, 12, 16, and 37. These changes were integrated into the broader documentation alignment effort reflected in commits from Nov 7–8, 2025.
