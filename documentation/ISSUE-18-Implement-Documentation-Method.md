# ISSUE-18-Implement-Documentation-Method

**Issue Type(s):** Documentation

## Objective:

Set up a standardized documentation method to ensure that all future issues, features, and processes are consistently documented and easy to reference.

## Description:

This branch introduces a documentation template file, a supporting script for creating new documentation entries, and updates to package.json for easier usage. Run the script with the following command

```bash
# npm run create-doc <issue_number> <issue_title>

npm run create-doc 18 Implement-Documentation-Method
```

## Learnings:

Learned how to structure issue-based documentation to improve traceability and maintain consistency across the project. Gained experience in linking scripts with documentation processes.

## What's next:

Adopt this documentation template across all active and future issues. Ensure contributors use the standardized process and refine the template if gaps are identified.

## Miscellaneous Notes:

Initial setup complete; further iterations may include automation for changelogs or integration with project boards.
