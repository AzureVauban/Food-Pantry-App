# ISSUE-31-create-search-bar-ui-for-recipe-discovery

**Issue Type(s):** Enhancement

## Objective:

The goal was to implement a functional and styled search bar UI for recipe discovery using React Native Paper.

## Description:

On this branch, the Searchbar component from React Native Paper was integrated into the app to enable users to search for recipes. Additionally, formatting cleanup was performed to ensure code consistency and readability. Since the branch became stale, conflicts with the current develop branch were resolved before finalizing the implementation.

## Miscellaneous Notes:

This PR was stale for some time and required syncing with the develop branch. Minor conflicts were resolved during this process before merging.
